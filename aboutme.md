My name is Khoi Dang Do. Welcome to my personal space on the internet!

## Who Am I?

I'm passionate about three things: **running**, **reading**, and **writing**.

Running keeps my body healthy and my mind clear. There's something magical about the rhythm of footsteps and the freedom of the open road that helps me think and reset.

Reading is my gateway to new worlds and ideas. Books have taught me more than I could ever learn on my own, and I'm constantly amazed by the wisdom others have shared through their words.

Writing this blog helps me capture and preserve the key insights from the books I read. It's my way of distilling complex ideas into notes I can revisit whenever I need a refresher or want to reinforce what I've learned.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is my digital notebook where I share summaries and insights from books I've read. Topics include:

- **Money & Personal Finance** - Understanding wealth, investing, and financial psychology
- **Personal Development** - Building better habits and improving life
- **History & Science** - Learning about humanity and the world around us
- **Travel** - Adventures and experiences from different places
- **Code & Technology** - Technical insights and programming notes

Each post is written for my future self, but I hope you'll find value in these notes too!
